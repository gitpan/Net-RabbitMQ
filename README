You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
        make test
	# (or) env MQHOST="localhost" make test
	make install
	
The documentation is in the module file.  Once you install
the file, you can read it with perldoc.

	perldoc Net::RabbitMQ
	
If you want to read it before you install it, you can use
perldoc directly on the module file.

	perldoc RabbitMQ.pm
